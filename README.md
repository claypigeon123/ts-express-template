A simple skeleton with sensible defaults to start developing with TS + Express.
Includes:

- Logging with Winston
- Typed env configuration in `environment.d.ts`, using Dotenv
- Extended response headers via Helmet
- Esbuild to produce a single JS file as the production build
- End-to-end Dockerfile
